                        A website made in HTML5, SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript to showcase who I am and 
                        projects I have worked on. I decided to make a portfolio in the more basic web development
                        technologies in order to improve my basic web development skills.
                    </p>

                    <p class="fs-400 ff-sans-normal text-black">
                        Before making this website, I actually had another web portfolio made in React, 
                        Bootstrap, and React Router. However, I noticed problems with it that inspired me 
                        to make a portfolio from scratch, which resulted in the website you are currently on.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="fs-400 ff-sans-normal text-black">
                        One of the main problems is that the old portfolio was built with a desktop first design, with 
                        mobile responsiveness being an afterthought that was rushed into the project at the last 
                        minute. In modern web development, responsiveness is a required aspect of modern websites,
                        especially with smartphones being the most prevalent device. As such, mobile-first design is 
                        recommended when designing front-end interfaces. This portfolio was built mobile-first while
                        constantly checking the bigger screen sizes as the website was developed.
                    </p>

                    <p class="fs-400 ff-sans-normal text-black">
                        Another problem with the old portfolio was a problem I affectionately call the "There's 
                        a library for that" problem. It also seems that this problem is more widespread if you look
                        at the answers on StackOverflow. When you are working in a JS framework like React, it feels like there is a library
                        for every problem you may encounter. This in itself is not a bad thing; why spend the effort to 
                        solve a problem that has already been solved? However, solving such problems without the use of 
                        libraries is beneficial to your learning of the languages.
                    </p>

                    <p class="fs-400 ff-sans-normal text-black">
                        I could spend longer picking apart the old portfolio, but the wall of text above is 
                        probably enough. Instead of listing out the features of the new portfolio, it might be fun to
                        look at specific examples and compare the two portfolios I have made for myself.

                    </div>
                    <p class="fs-400 ff-sans-normal text-black">
                        The main differences between the functionality of the nav bars are the changes in 
                        links that stem from the different layouts of the portfolios and the interactivity 
                        with the links and the drop-downs. The previous portfolio did not have hover effects
                        for the project link and activated the drop-down with a click. The current portfolio
                        has a projects section on the main page, so clicking the link goes to the section while
                        the drop-down is activated with a mouse hover. Although it is subjective, I feel like 
                        the current portfolio's nav bar is much better in terms of its style, with active link 
                        indicators, a better layout, and a drop-down that lines up better.

                        In the old portfolio, the specific projects remained inside a drop-down in the mobile drop-down menu.
                        In the current portfolio, the specific projects were not hidden in a drop-down. In the mobile layout for 
                        both portfolios, the user has to provide an extra input to show the navigation. I felt that it was
                        more tedious to access the specific projects in a nested drop-down menu since it would add an additional
                        input.

                        From a strictly objective standpoint, the about me section in the current portfolio simply has more
                        information contained within itself. Whether this is a good thing or not is up for debate. Should the
                        about section be more thorough so as to give the reader more information about myself? Or should the about section
                        be more succinct so as to allow the reader to gather the main points in less time? I tried to strike a balance
                        in the current portfolio. While I could have typed out my entire life story, doing so would only be a waste of
                        time for me and anyone reading the section. So I included enough to get a sense of my interests and my background.

                        From a style standpoint, I feel like the current section is more visully interesting and eyecatching

                        and manga.

                        In the old portfolio, there was a section exclusively for my contact email. In the current portfolio,
                        my contact links were moved to the footer of the website, which is more in line with many modern websites.
                        Having the contact links in the footer makes more sense in terms of visibility and space. In the old
                        portfolio, the contact section was taking up 100% of the device screen height, which is excessive for a single
                        email. In the current portfolio, the links take up less space and are visible at the bottom of the page,
                        no matter which page you are on.

                        In the current portfolio, the links are naturally clickable. This makes emailing me slightly more convenient.
                        In the old portfolio, the email icon and text were not clickable, meaning anyone who wanted to email me would
                        have to type out the email address or copy and paste it into their email app of choice.

                <p class="fs-400 ff-sans-normal text-black">
                    In my opinion, the current portfolio is a big improvement in comparison to the old portfolio. In terms of
                    style, the current portfolio is more visually interesting. The current portfolio has better illustrations, animations,
                    and a more consistent colour palette. I believe that the layout is more interesting, especially in the about section,
                    and effective in accessing information as shown in the new projects section. The current portfolio is more responsive and has
                    better mobile navigation. Despite being a significant upgrade over the old portfolio, the new portfolio has a ton of room
                    for improvement.   
                </p>

                <p class="fs-400 ff-sans-normal text-black">
                    One of the biggest improvements that can be made on to the current portfolio comes from the biggest resolutions. 
                    The layout of the website was developed on a 1920x1080 screen resolution, which means checking the larger 
                    resolutions like 2560x1440 (2K) and 3840x2160 (4K) is an annoying task. The best you can really do is simulate 
                    the higher resolutions by using a zoomed-in view. The website should be fine on larger resolutions, but from a style 
                    standpoint, things might look weird and spaced out. Improving the layout for larger resolutions becomes more important 
                    as higher resolution screens become more common.
                </p>
                
                <p class="fs-400 ff-sans-normal text-black">
                    I feel like the accessibility of the website has a long way to go until I am satisfied with it. Improving
                    accessibility requires a lot of studying best practices for accessibility as well as experience when it comes to 
                    things like writing good alt tags for images.
                </p>

                <p class="fs-400 ff-sans-normal text-black">
                    Despite still having areas that can be improved, the portfolio has accomplished what I set out to do when I decided
                    to remake it: show who I am and projects I have worked on while improving my skills in the basic web development
                    technologies of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned a ton while making this website, and like the portfolio, my knowledge
                    in this area has plenty of opportunity to improve. Thus, I will continue to study, learn, and improve, while hopefully improving
                    this website as I do.

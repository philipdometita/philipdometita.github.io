                    A web app for archiving and searching through the games playable by the Everdeck. The app was built 
                    by a three person team in Next.js with a MongoDB backend and deployed on Vercel. Using the app, 
                    you can use searches or filters to find a game you want to play and find the rules and card mappings 
                    for that game. The app can be found at <a href="everdeck-library.vercel.app" aria-label="Everdeck Library link">everdeck-library.vercel.app</a>.
                    If you want more information about the Everdeck, check out the about page of our app <a href="everdeck-library.vercel.app/about"  aria-label="Everdeck Library about page link">here</a>.

                    If you know the name of the game you want to play, you can use the search bar at the top of the 
                    main page. You can also sort the games currently on the main page in ascending or descending
                    order by using the buttons located below the search bar.

                            If you know some of the qualities of a game you want to play but don't know the exact game (ex. a game for 4 players), you
                            can use the filter menu. 
                        </p>

                            The filter menu has sliders to choose the minimum and maximum values for player count, play time, and complexity.

                            There is a dropdown to choose a mapping strength of a game which represents how well the game maps to the Everdeck.
                            There are 4 options: "Perfect", "High", "Low", and "Any". (More information on mapping strength can be found on the "How To" on the
                            Everdeck Library app which can be accessed by clicking the "?" button on the bottom left of the page)

                            Checkboxes are provided to choose external components (things in addition to the Everdeck that a game requires to play. ex. Dice)

                <p class="fs-400 ff-sans-normal">
                    Once you have found a game you are interested in, you can click or tap on the card 
                    to go to that game's rule page. At the top of the page you can find the game's box art, the basic stats
                    of the game (that are visible on the card), a longer summary of the game, and a link to the BoardGameGeek page for 
                    the game. Depending on the device you are using to use the app, there should be buttons you can use to jump to the 
                    various sections of the rules page.  
                </p>
                <p class="fs-400 ff-sans-normal">
                    If the game has any warnings, more details of the warnings can be found below the summary. 
                    Below any warnings will be the rules section, which contains the rules of the game.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-400 ff-sans-normal">
                    The rules section consists of two parts: the card zones and the rules.
                </p>
                <div class="everdeck-cardzones flex">

                            Each game can have one or more types of cards. For example, the game Uno has normal coloured number cards and
                            wild cards. The game For Sale that is used in the example image has property and currency cards. 
                            The card zone shows which part of an Everdeck card is used to indentify the game card it maps to.
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-400 ff-sans-normal">
                            Hovering or tapping on a card zone will highlight the section of the card that is relevant to the card zone
                        </p>
                        <p class="fs-400 ff-sans-normal">
                            You may have noticed that some of the words in the rules stand out. These are key words of the game's rules
                            that are relevant to the game's card zones. Hovering the key words will also highlight the card zone and vice versa.
                            If you are on a mobile device, tapping a keyword will jump back to the card zone section so the user can see the 
                            highlight since having both the rules and the card zone on screen at the same time is not feasible on smaller screens.
